This database converts the waveforms from speech corpus TIDIGITS into spike patterns.


1. The dataset is divided into training set and testing set.
2. The encoded spike pattern is saved in the MATLAB -mat file: Spike-TIDIGITS.m
3. The spike patterns are saved in the form of exact firing timings, in the unit of ms.
4. For more encoding details, please refer to our paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01302.pdf
5. For more information of the original TIDIGITS database, please refer to the manual of TIDIGITS from: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S10
