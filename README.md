## To Do's:

For ToDo's see [Tasks Projects](https://github.com/R1704/SpeechRecognitionSNN/projects/1). Assign yourself a Task and move it to `In Progress`.
- For creating a new `To Do`:
  * create the new `To Do` as a [new Issue](https://github.com/R1704/SpeechRecognitionSNN/issues/new)
  * go to the [_Tasks_ project](https://github.com/R1704/SpeechRecognitionSNN/projects/1)
  * click on the `To Do` swimlane and click `Add Cards`. The filter should automatically show you the newly created issue as a card. 
  * drag and drop it onto the `To Do` or `In Progress` swimlane
  * and assign it to you or the responsible contributor(s).
