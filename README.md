# SpeechRecognitionSNN

## TODOS:

For ToDo's see [Tasks Projects](https://github.com/R1704/SpeechRecognitionSNN/projects/1). Assign yourself a Task and move it to `In Progress`.
- For creating a new `To Do`:
  * create it as an Issue
  * go to the [_Tasks_ project](https://github.com/R1704/SpeechRecognitionSNN/projects/1)
  * click on the _To Do_ swimlane and click _Add Cards_. The filter should automatically show you the newly created issue as a card. 
  * drag and drop it onto the _To Do_ or _In Progress_ swimlane
  * and assign it to you or the responsible contributor(s).
