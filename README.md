# SpeechRecognitionSNN

A university course project that replicated the study from  \[Dong M., Huang X., Xu B. 2018\] (Unsupervised speech recognition through spike-timing-dependent plasticity in a convolutional spiking neural network).

Our implementation of the model that is described in the paper by Dong et al.
